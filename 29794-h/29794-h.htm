<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Stiff</span> with shock, Naomi
Heckscher stood just inside
the door to Cappy's one-room
cabin, where she'd happened
to be when her husband
discovered the old man's body.</p>

<p>Her nearest neighbor&mdash;old
Cappy&mdash;dead. After all his wire-pulling
to get into the First
Group, and his slaving to make a
farm on this alien planet, dead in
bed!</p>

<p>Naomi's mind circled frantically,
contrasting her happy anticipations
with this shocking actuality.
She'd come to call on a
friend, she reminded herself, a
beloved friend&mdash;round, white-haired,
rosy-cheeked; lonely because
he'd recently become a
widower. To her little boy, Cappy
was a combination Grandpa and
Santa Claus; to herself, a sort of
newly met Old Beau.</p>

<p>Her mouth had been set for a
sip of his home brew, her eyes
had pictured the delight he'd take
in and give to her little boy.</p>

<p>She'd walked over with son and
husband, expecting nothing more
shocking than an ostentatiously
stolen kiss. She'd found a corpse.
And to have let Cappy die alone,
in this strange world ...</p>

<p>She and Ted could at least
have been with him, if they'd
known.</p>

<p>But they'd been laughing and
singing in their own cabin only
a mile away, celebrating Richard's
fifth birthday. She'd been annoyed
when Cappy failed to show
up with the present he'd promised
Richard. Annoyed&mdash;while the
old man pulled a blanket over his
head, turned his round face to
the wall, and died.</p>

<p>Watching compassionately, Naomi
was suddenly struck by the
matter-of-fact way Ted examined
the body. Ted wasn't surprised.</p>

<p>"Why did you tell Richard to
stay outside, just now?" she demanded.
"How did you know
what we'd find here? And why
didn't you tell me, so I could
keep Richard at home?"</p>

<p>She saw Ted start, scalded by
the splash of her self-directed
anger, saw him try to convert his
wince into a shrug.</p>

<p>"You insisted on coming," he
reminded her gently. "I couldn't
have kept you home without&mdash;without
saying too much, worrying
you&mdash;with the Earth-ship
still a year away. Besides, I didn't
know for sure, till we saw the
tree-things around the cabin."</p>

<p>The tree-things. The trees-that-were-not.
Gnarled blue trunks,
half-hidden by yellow leaf-needles
stretching twenty feet into the
sky. Something like the hoary
mountain hemlocks she and Ted
had been forever photographing
on their Sierra honeymoon,
seven life-long years ago.</p>

<p>Three of those tree-things had
swayed over Cappy's spring for
a far longer time than Man had
occupied this dreadful planet.
Until just now ...</p>

<p>The three of them had topped
the rise that hid Cappy's farm
from their own. Richard was running
ahead like a happily inquisitive
puppy. Suddenly he'd
stopped, pointing with a finger
she distinctly recalled as needing
thorough soapy scrubbing.</p>

<p>"Look, Mommie!" he'd said.
"Cappy's trees have moved.
They're around the cabin, now."</p>

<p>He'd been interested, not surprised.
In the past year, Mazda
had become Richard's home; only
Earth could surprise him.</p>

<p>But, Ted, come to think of it,
had seemed withdrawn, his face
a careful blank. And she?</p>

<p>"Very pretty," she'd said, and
stuffed the tag-end of fear back
into the jammed, untidy mental
pigeon-hole she used for all unpleasant
thoughts. "Don't run too
far ahead, dear."</p>

<p>But now she had to know what
Ted knew.</p>

<p>"Tell me!" she said.</p>

<p>"These tree-things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There've been <i>other</i> deaths!
How many?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen. But I didn't want to
tell you. Orders were to leave
women and children home when
we had that last Meeting, remember."</p>

<p>"What did they say at the
Meeting? Out with it, Ted!"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that the tree-things
think!"</p>

<p>"But that's ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Well, unfortunately, no. Look,
I'm not trying to tell you that
terrestrial trees think, too, nor
even that they have a nervous
system. They don't. But&mdash;well,
on Earth, if you've ever touched
a lighted match to the leaf of a
sensitive plant like the mimosa,
say&mdash;and I have&mdash;you've been
struck by the speed with which
<i>other</i> leaves close up and droop.
I mean, sure, we know that the
leaves droop because certain cells
exude water and nearby leaves
feel the heat of the match. But
the others don't, yet they droop,
too. Nobody knows how it
works ..."</p>

<p>"But <i>that's</i> just defensive!"</p>

<p>"Sure. But <i>that's</i> just on
Earth!"</p>

<p>"All right, dear. I won't argue
any more. But I still don't understand.
Go on about the Meeting."</p>

<p>"Well, they said these tree-things
both create and respond to
the patterned electrical impulses
of the mind. It's something like
the way a doctor creates fantasies
by applying a mild electric current
to the right places on a patient's
brain. In the year we've
been here, the trees&mdash;or some of
them&mdash;have learned to read from
and transmit to our minds. The
range, they say, is around fifty
feet. But you have to be receptive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Receptive?"</p>

<p>"Fearful. That's the condition.
So I didn't want to tell you because
you <i>must not</i> let yourself
become afraid, Naomi. We're
clearing trees from the land, in
certain areas. And it's their
planet, after all. Fear is their
weapon and fear can kill!"</p>

<p>"You still&mdash;all you men&mdash;should
have let us women know!
What do you think we are? Besides,
I don't really believe you.
How can fear kill?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you ever heard of a
savage who gets in bad with his
witch-doctor and is killed by
magic? The savage is convinced,
having seen or heard of other
cases, that he <i>can</i> be killed. The
witch-doctor sees to it he's told
he <i>will</i> be killed. And sometimes
the savage actually dies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From poison, I've always
thought."</p>

<p>"The poison of fear. The physical
changes that accompany
fear, magnified beyond belief by
belief itself."</p>

<p>"But how in the world could
all this have affected Cappy? He
wasn't a savage. And he was elderly,
Ted. A bad heart, maybe.
A stroke. Anything."</p>

<p>"He passed his pre-flight physical
only a year ago. And&mdash;well,
he lived all alone. He was careful
not to let you see it, but I know
he worried about these three trees
on his place. And I know he got
back from the Meeting in a worried
state of mind. Then, obviously,
the trees moved&mdash;grouped
themselves around his cabin
within easy range. But don't be
afraid of them, Naomi. So long
as you're not, they can't hurt
you. They're not bothering us
now."</p>

<p>"No. But where's Richard?"</p>

<p>Naomi's eyes swept past Ted,
encompassing the cabin. No
Richard! He'd been left outside ...</p>

<p>Glass tinkled and crashed as
she flung back the cabin door.
"Richard! Richard!"</p>

<p>Her child was not in sight. Nor
within earshot, it seemed.</p>

<p>"Richard Heckscher! Where
are you?" Sanity returned with
the conventional primness. And it
brought her answer.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Mommie! Look-at!"</p>

<p>He was in a tree! He was fifteen
feet off the ground, high in
the branches of a tree-thing,
swaying&mdash;</p>

<p>For an instant, dread flowed
through Naomi as if in her
bloodstream and something was
cutting off her breath. Then, as
the hands over mouth and throat
withdrew, she saw they were
Ted's. She let him drag her into
the cabin and close the broken
door.</p>

<p>"Better not scare Richard," he
said quietly, shoving her gently
into a chair. "He might fall."</p>

<p>Dumbly she caught her breath,
waiting for the bawling out she'd
earned.</p>

<p>But Ted said, "Richard keeps
us safe. So long as we fear for
him, and not ourselves&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was easy to do. Outside,
she heard a piping call: "Look at
me now, Mommie!"</p>

<p>"Showing off!" she gasped. In a
flashing vision, Richard was half
boy, half vulture, flapping to the
ground with a broken wing.</p>

<p>"Here," said Ted, picking up
a notebook that had been on the
table. "Here's Cappy's present. A
homemade picture book. Bait."</p>

<p>"Let <i>me</i> use it!" she said.
"Richard may have seen I was
scared just now."</p>

<p>Outside again, under the tree,
she called, "Here's Cappy's present,
Richard. He's gone away and
left it for you."</p>

<p>Would he notice how her voice
had gone up half an octave, become
flat and shrill?</p>

<p>"I'm coming down," Richard
said. "Let me down, tree."</p>

<p>He seemed to be struggling.
The branches were cagelike. He
was caught!</p>

<p>Naomi's struggle was with her
voice. "How did you <i>ever</i> get up
there?" she called.</p>

<p>"The tree let me up, Mommie,"
Richard explained solemnly, "but
he won't let me down!" He whimpered
a little.</p>

<p>He must <i>not</i> become frightened!
"You tell that tree you've
got to come right down this instant!"
she ordered.</p>

<p>She leaned against the cabin
for support. Ted came out and
slipped his arm around her.</p>

<p>"Break off a few leaves,
Richard," he suggested. "That'll
show your tree who's boss!"</p>

<p>Standing close against her husband,
Naomi tried to stop shaking.
But she lacked firm support,
for Ted shook, too.</p>

<p>His advice to Richard was
sound, though. What had been a
trap became, through grudging
movement of the branches, a ladder.
Richard climbed down, scolding
at the tree like an angry
squirrel.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Naomi</span> thought she'd succeeded
in shutting her mind.
But when her little boy slid down
the final bit of trunk and came for
his present, Naomi broke. Like a
startled animal, she thrust the
book into his hands, picked him
up and ran. Her mind was a jelly,
red and quaking.</p>

<p>She stopped momentarily after
running fifty yards. "Burn the
trees!" she screamed over her
shoulder. "Burn the cabin! Burn
it all!" She ran on, Ted's answering
shouts beyond her comprehension.</p>

<p>Fatigue halted her. At the top
of the rise between Cappy's farm
and their own, pain and dizziness
began flowing over her in waves.
She set Richard down on the
mauve soil and collapsed beside
him.</p>

<p>When she sat up, Richard
squatted just out of reach, watching
curiously. She made an effort
at casualness: "Let's see what
Daddy's doing back there."</p>

<p>"He's doing just what you said
to, Mommie!" Richard answered
indignantly.</p>

<p>Her men were standing together,
Naomi realized. She
laughed. After a moment, Richard
joined her. Then he looked for his
book, found it a few paces away,
and brought it to her.</p>

<p>"Read to me, Mommie."</p>

<p>"At home," she said.</p>

<p>Activity at Cappy's interested
her now. Wisps of smoke were
licking around the trees. A tongue
of flame lapped at one while she
watched. Branches writhed. The
trees were too slow-moving to
escape ...</p>

<p>But where was Ted? What had
she exposed him to, with her
hysterical orders? She held her
breath till he moved within sight,
standing quietly by a pile of salvaged
tools. Behind him the cabin
began to smoke.</p>

<p>Ted wasn't afraid, then. He
understood what he faced. And
Richard wasn't afraid, either, because
he didn't understand.</p>

<p>But she? Surreptitiously Naomi
pinched her hip till it felt black
and blue. That was for being such
a fool. She must <i>not</i> be afraid!</p>

<p>"Daddy seems to be staying
there," she said. "Let's wait for
him at home, Richard."</p>

<p>"Are you going to make Daddy
burn <i>our</i> tree?"</p>

<p>She jumped as if stung. Then,
consciously womanlike, she sought
relief in talk.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think we should
do, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>like</i> the tree, Mommie.
It's cool under there. And the
tree plays with me."</p>

<p>"How, Richard?"</p>

<p>"If I'm pilot, he's navigator.
Or ship, maybe. But he's so
dumb, Mommie! I always have to
tell him everything. Doesn't
know what a fairy is, or Goldilocks,
or anything!"</p>

<p>He clutched his book affectionately,
rubbing his face on it.
"Hurry up, Mommie. It'll be
bedtime before you ever read to
me!"</p>

<p>She touched his head briefly.
"You can look at the book while
I fix your supper."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But</span> to explain Cappy's pictures&mdash;crudely
crayoned cartoons,
really&mdash;she had to fill in
the story they illustrated. She
told it while Richard ate: how
the intrepid Spaceman gallantly
used his ray gun against the villainous
Martians to aid the green-haired
Princess. Richard spooned
up the thrills with his mush, gazing
fascinated at Cappy's colorful
and fantastic pictures, propped
before him on the table. Had Ted
been home, the scene might almost
have been blissful.</p>

<p>It might have been ... if their
own tree hadn't reminded her of
Cappy's. Still, she'd almost managed
to stuff her fear back into
that mental pigeon-hole before
their own tree. It was unbelievable,
but she'd been glancing out
the window every few minutes,
so she saw it start. Their own tree
began to walk.</p>

<p>Down the hill it came&mdash;right
there!&mdash;framed in the window behind
Richard's head, moving
slowly but inexorably on a root
system that writhed along the
surface. Like some ancient sculpture
of Serpents Supporting the
Tree of Life. Except that it
brought death ...</p>

<p>"Are you sick, Mommie?"</p>

<p>No, not sick. Just something
the matter with her throat, preventing
a quick answer, leaving
no way to keep Richard from
turning to look out the window.</p>

<p>"I think our tree is coming to
play with me, Mommie."</p>

<p>No, no! Not Richard!</p>

<p>"Remember how you used to
say that about Cappy? When he
was really coming to see your
daddy?"</p>

<p>"But Daddy isn't home!"</p>

<p>"He'll get here, dear. Now eat
your supper."</p>

<p>A lot to ask of an excited little
boy. And the tree <i>was</i> his friend,
it seemed. Cappy's tree had even
followed the child's orders.
Richard might intercede&mdash;</p>

<p>No! Expose him to such danger?
How could she think of it?</p>

<p>"Had enough to eat, dear?
Wash your hands and face at the
pump, and you can stay out and
play till Daddy gets home. I&mdash;I
want&mdash;&mdash;I may have to see your
friend, the tree, by myself ..."</p>

<p>"But you haven't finished my
story!"</p>

<p>"I will when Daddy gets home.
And if I'm not here, you tell
Daddy to do it."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Mommie?"</p>

<p>"I might see Cappy, dear. Now
go and wash, please!"</p>

<p>"Sure, Mommie. Don't cry."</p>

<p>Accept his kiss, even if it <i>is</i>
from a mouth rimmed with supper.
And don't rub it off till he's
gone out, you damned fool. You
frightened fool. You shaking,
sweating, terror-stricken fool.</p>

<p>Who's he going to kiss when
you're not here?</p>

<p>The tree has stopped. Our little
tree is having its supper. How
nice. Sucking sustenance direct
from soil with aid of sun and air
in true plant fashion&mdash;but exhausting
our mineral resources.</p>

<p>(How wise of Ted to make you
go to those lectures! You wouldn't
want to die in ignorance, would
you?)</p>

<p>The lecture&mdash;come on, let's go
back to the lecture! Let's free
our soil from every tree or we'll
not hold the joint in fee. No, not
joint. A vulgarism, teacher would
say. Methinks the times are out
of joint. Aroint thee, tree!</p>

<p>Now a pinch. Pinch yourself
hard in the same old place so
it'll hurt real bad. Then straighten
your face and go stick your head
out the window. Your son is talking&mdash;your
son, your sun.</p>

<p>Can your son be eclipsed by a
tree? A matter of special spatial
relationships, and the space is
shrinking, friend. The tree is only
a few hundred feet from the
house. It has finished its little
supper and is now running
around. Like Richard. <i>With</i>
Richard! Congenial, what?</p>

<p>Smile, stupid. Your son speaks.
Answer him.</p>

<p>"What, dear?"</p>

<p>"I see Daddy! He just came
over the hill. He's running! Can
I go meet him, Mommie?"</p>

<p>"No, dear. It's too far."</p>

<p>Too far. Far too far.</p>

<p>"Did you say something to me,
Richard?"</p>

<p>"No. I was talking to the tree.
I'm the Spaceman and he's the
Martian. But he doesn't want to
be the Martian!"</p>

<p>Richard plays. Let us play.
Let us play.</p>

<p>You're close enough to get into
the game, surely. A hundred and
fifty feet, maybe. Effective range,
fifty feet. Rate of motion? Projected
time-interval? Depends on
which system you observe it from.
Richard has a system.</p>

<p>"He doesn't want to play,
Mommie. He wants to see you!"</p>

<p>"You tell that tree your Mommie
<i>never</i> sees strangers when
Daddy isn't home!"</p>

<p>"I'll <i>make</i> him wait!"</p>

<p>Stoutly your pot-bellied little
protector prevents his protective
mother from going to pot.</p>

<p>"If he won't play, I'll use my
ray gun on him!"</p>

<p>Obviously, the tree won't play.
Watch your son lift empty hands,
arm himself with a weapon yet
to be invented, and open fire
on the advancing foe.</p>

<p>"Aa-aa-aa!"</p>

<p>So <i>that's</i> how a ray gun sounds!</p>

<p>"You're dead, tree! You're
dead! Now you <i>can't</i> play with
me any more. You're dead!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Seeing</span> it happen, then, watching
the tree accept the little
boy's fantasy as fact, Naomi wondered
why she'd never thought of
that herself.</p>

<p>So the tree was a treacherous
medicine-man, was it? A true-believing
witch-doctor? And who
could be more susceptible to the
poisoning of fear than a witch-doctor
who has made fear work&mdash;and
believes it's being used against
him?</p>

<p>It was all over. She and the
tree bit the dust together. But
the tree was dead, and Naomi
merely fainting, and Ted would
soon be home ...</p>
